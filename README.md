## Simple Python Calculator 🧮
A sleek, functional Graphical User Interface (GUI) calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. This project handles basic arithmetic operations with built-in error handling for a smooth user experience.

## 🚀 Features
* Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* Error Handling: Specific logic to catch ZeroDivisionError and general invalid inputs using messagebox alerts.

* Clear Function: A "C" button to reset the display instantly.

* Responsive Grid: Buttons are organized in a clean 4x4 grid that expands evenly.

* Clean Design: Uses a non-resizable window with right-justified text for a professional feel.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python 3

* Tkinter: For the window, buttons, and grid layout.

* Eval Function: Utilized for dynamic mathematical expression evaluation.

## 📋 How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.

2. Save the code as calculator.py.

3. Open your terminal and run:
python calculator.py

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
* Lambda Functions: Used lambda inside a loop to assign unique actions to buttons efficiently.

* Grid Geometry Manager: Implemented sticky="nsew" and grid_weight to ensure the UI looks consistent across different screen scalings.

* Try-Except Blocks: Robust handling of edge cases to prevent the application from crashing.
